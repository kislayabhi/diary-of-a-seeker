   <p>
    So who is a seeker? To seek something, one must admit that one doesn't have that thing which one is seeking.
   </p>

    Is it easy to admit that? I don't think so.
    To be a seeker, one must have humility and thorough understanding that one anxiously needs that thing which one is seeking.
